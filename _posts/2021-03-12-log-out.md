Now, let's make a log out page. 
Go to views.py in apis.
Make a UserLogoutView class.
Then, go to urls.py in apis.
Add the new path.

Then, go to home.html and make a log out button.

Once we make the login and logout buttons, we can try to separate the log in page.

Go to views.py in contents folder.
Add log in view class. 
```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.views.generic.base import TemplateView
from django.utils.decorators import method_decorator
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required


class HomeView(TemplateView):
    @method_decorator(login_required)
    def dispatch(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        return super(HomeView, self).dispatch(request, *args, **kwargs)
        
    template_name = 'home.html'
```
Then, go to settings.py file and add LOGIN_URL.

Then, go to urls.py in moonGram and add the login path.

After that, create login.html.
